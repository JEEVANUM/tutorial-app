TUTORIAL APP USING MVVM BUILD ARCHITECTURE.
A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

Flutter is defined as the Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile (Android, iOS ) desktop (Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia) and the web from a single codebase. Since Flutter is cross-platform, you can use the same code base for your iOS and Android app. This can definitely save you both time and resources. The code will be easily readable, maintainable and sustainable. You will build presentation layer, data layer, domain layer and application layer step by step. This architecture is designed to make it easier to create stable apps even when outer elements such as UI, databases, or external APIs are always changing.
